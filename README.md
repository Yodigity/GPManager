# PrescriptionManager

This project imitates the systems used within a GP Practice surgery environment. Allowing users to modify and add patient information (inc. Prescriptions & Patient History). 
Users are also able to send Sms messages to patients when their prescriptions are due for renewal.

# Motivation
Patients are not being informed when their prescriptions are due for renewal. This project solves this issue by sending SMS messages to patients when their prescription is within
two weeks of their renewal date.

The planned outcome is that patients will be able to book an appointment with their GP to renew their prescriptions within an appropriate timeframe. This will reduce 
the likelihood of patients being unable to have their prescriptions renewed, therefore leading to complaints.
